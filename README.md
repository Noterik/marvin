Image generation service

1) Check out Edna in Eclipse
2) Adjust the config in GlobalConfig class
3) Build a war using the 'deploy-war' task with the provided build.xml
4) Deploy the war on a Tomcat server

After these steps you can access your videos like this:

http://[yourhost]:[yourport]/edna/domain/[image url]

This will give you a image and cache it based on the input params (see the manual)
